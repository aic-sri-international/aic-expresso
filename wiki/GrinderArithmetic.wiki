#summary Arithmetic Rewriters

The most basic types of rewriters are the arithmetic ones, implementing basic operations such as addition and multiplication of numbers. Given an expression in which these functions are applied to number symbols, these rewriters replace them by the correct result. Additionally, however, and most importantly, these rewriters apply even when the symbols involved are not numbers, but unknown quantities, rewriting expressions such as `x + 1 + 2` and `0*x` into `x + 3` and `0`, respectively.
