#summary Logic Rewriters

A collection of Rewriters is included that can be applied to first order logic formulas.

===Logical Connectives===
  * `not` (negation) e.g.s: 
{{{
not true  -> false
not false -> true
not not X -> X
}}}
  * `and` (conjunction) e.g.s:
{{{
true and false -> false
true and X     -> X
and()          -> true
}}}
  * `or` (disjunction) e.g.s:
{{{
true or false -> true
false or X    -> X
or()          -> false
}}}
  * `=>` (implies) e.g.s:
{{{
X => Y -> not(X) or Y
}}}
  * `<=>` (equivalence) e.g.s:
{{{
X <=> Y -> (X and Y) or (not(X) and not(Y))
}}}

===Quantification===
In addition, support for the standard quantification in first order logic:
  * `there exists . : .` (existential) : `there exists X : X != a`
  * `for all . : .` (universal): `for all X : X = a or X = b or X = c`

*Note:* Quantification of more than one variable is achieved by nesting the quantifiers, for example:

`for all X : for all Y : X != Y`

In standard first order logic, quantification can typically be done on variables only. We allow [QuantificationOfFunctionApplications function applications to be quantified as well].
