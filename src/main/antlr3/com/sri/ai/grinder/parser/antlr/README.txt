The ANTLR LPI parser has four stages, each of which is defined in its own
file: lexer, parser, associative node walker, and output walker.  

The lexer tokenizes the input.  

The parser inspects the token stream and matches it against recognized 
grammar rules and creates an AST.  

The associative node walker identifies chains of identical associative 
nodes and consolidates them into a single node with all of the children.  

And the output walker takes the AST in ANTLR's native CommonTree type and 
converts it into the expected Expression 
node AST.


Adding new grammar rules
========================
Below is an overview of how to add new grammar rules to the parser.  
Detailed instructions for how to add new grammar rules to the parser
can be found in the appropriate files.

In the lexer:  
Add any new terminal symbols as constants.

In the parser: 
Add the new grammar rules and define the AST node structure for the rule.
Add function and symbol forms of the new rules if the rule uses only
one terminal symbol.

In the associative node walker:
If the new rule is associative, add to the bottom-up rule to consolidate
consecutive associative operation nodes.

In the output walker:
Add to the expr rule to convert from ANTLR's native AST node type to
the appropriate output type for the new grammar rules.
