/**
 * A class providing a static method for substituting symbols or function applications in an expression
 * by another expression (not subject itself to the same substitution, which would either not occur or lead to an infinite recursion).
 * 
 * This is a simpler, less exhaustive version of {@link SemanticSubstitute} that takes into account only syntactic information,
 * that is, it only replaces an expression by a value if the expression is represented with the same symbols
 * as the originally searched ones. Here are a few examples to make this more clear:
 * 
 * Replacing a symbol works as one would expect:
 * 
 * Replacing <code>X</code> by 99 in <code>foo</code> returns <code>foo</code>
 * Replacing <code>X</code> by 99 in <code>X</code> returns <code>99</code>
 * 
 * However, quantifications need to be taken into account:
 * replacing <code>X</code> by 99 in <code>X + if there exists X : X = 9 then X else 0</code> returns <code>99 + if there exists X : X = 9 then 99 else 0</code>
 * because the quantified X works as a distinct variable. Its scope is limited to the if's condition,
 * so the X in the then branch corresponds to the original X.
 * 
 * When replacing a function substitution, the function's corresponding "cell" has its value replaced.
 * Here are some examples:
 * 
 * Replacing <code>f(10)</code> by 99 in <code>f(9)</code> returns <code>f(9)</code>
 * Replacing <code>f(Y)</code> by 99 in <code>f(Y)</code> returns <code>99</code>
 * Replacing <code>f(10)</code> by 99 in <code>f(X)</code> returns <code>f(X)</code>
 * even though, semantically speaking, <code>X</code> could be equal to <code>10</code>.
 * Semantic substitution would have returned <code>if X = 10 then 99 else f(X)</code>
 * Replacing <code>f(Y)</code> by 99 in <code>f(X)</code> returns <code>if X = Y then 99 else f(X)</code>
 *
 * When replacing a function application, quantification of either the function symbol or the arguments will prevent
 * further replacement down the expression:
 * 
 * Replacing <code>f(X)</code> by 99 in <code>f(X) + (for all g : g(f(X))) + (for all f : f(X)) + (for all X : f(X))</code>
 * returns <code>99 + (for all g : g(99)) + (for all f : f(X)) + (for all X : f(X))</code>
